# The purpose of this script is to automate the post-installation configuration
# to achieve my personal ideal setup.  Since I have several computers, I often
# find myself repeating these steps many times, since I have a tendency to
# experiment a little too much and have a bad habit of distro-hopping!  However,
# if I ever learn to kick the distro-hopping habit/hobby, there's a chance
# that I might make this awesome script and then never end up using it again!
# Of course, this might make it even easier to experiment with all the distros
# since I now have an easy way of restoring my Debian back to it's ideal state,
# so it also might make my distro-hopping even worse...  WTF...
